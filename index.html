<p>My name is Lavi Yatziv, and I am a Web Developer and technophile who currently lives in Telkwa, BC.</p>
<p>A graduate of Carleton University&#39;s Film program as well as Algonquin College&#39;s Radio and TV Broadcasting studies, my work is situated at the juncture between digital and more traditional media. My thorough understanding of both allows me to create beautiful yet functional websites, promotional videos and animation. Troubleshooting and improving functionality for existing websites are among my specialties.</p>
<p>This site represents some of work in photography, web design, and digital animation I have been engaged in for over 10 years - please have a look around!</p>
